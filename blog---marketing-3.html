        <p class="paragraph-40">Did you know that complexity can be one of the biggest threats to business growth? Time and time again, renowned companies have fallen into the trap of complexity by trying to do too much. They want to offer many product options, represent multiple ideas, and convey a variety of messages. However, this can be dangerous. Let me show you why by using a notable example from Apple.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-42">Apple is an iconic and successful company today, but it wasn&#x27;t always that way. In 1985, Steve Jobs was fired from the company he co-founded. After his departure, Apple began to suffer due to excessive complexity in its products. </p>
        <p class="paragraph-41">At the business level, Apple stopped focusing on producing a few quality products and instead tried to launch a slew of new innovations, many of which were not well-received by the market. They tried to capitalize on the success of the Apple II with numerous variants and spin-offs, and they also developed new products like the Apple Newton, which was an utter failure. What was the main problem behind this failure? Complexity. The company became obsessed with creating many new things without first making sure they were products that people actually wanted.</p>
        <h4 class="heading-53">Reference 1: Apple created a variety of unwanted products,such as the Apple Newton, due to excessive complexity in its business decisions.</h4>
        <p class="paragraph-43">At the brand level, Apple also lost its focus and purpose. The constant stream of new products led the company to communicate in a confusing and disconnected way. In short, the brand became too complex and inconsistent in its messaging and behavior. </p>
        <p class="paragraph-45">The Power of Simplicity. </p>
        <p class="paragraph-44">Fortunately, Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, and one of the most important decisions he made was to embrace simplicity. </p>
        <p class="paragraph-46">Jobs radically simplified Apple&#x27;s product line, eliminating around 70% of new product lines. Instead of trying to do everything, Apple focused on developing a single brilliant product in two variants: the iconic MacBook and the Apple desktop. This simplified strategy allowed Apple to regain its focus and clarity. </p>
        <h4 class="heading-54">Reference 2: Apple went back to basics with a simplified and focusedproduct line.</h4>
        <p class="paragraph-47">By simplifying its offerings, Apple also clarified its brand identity. The company realized that it could not compete directly with other large technology companies, so it decided to play by its own rules. By looking at who its customers were and what they valued, Apple discovered that it was not just another technology company. In fact, they considered themselves makers of tools for creative minds. This strategic shift allowed Apple to stand out in a saturated market.</p>

        <h4 class="heading-55">Reference 3: A strategic shift towards simplicity helped Apple focus ts brand and deliver successful products like the iPod, iTunes, and Apple TV.</h4>

        <ol start="" role="list" class="list">
          <li class="list-item-2">Simplicity is not about minimalism or doing less. It&#x27;s about doing the right things and doing them well.</li>
          <li class="list-item-3">Simplicity requires a deep understanding of your customers and their needs. Focus on what matters most to them and eliminate the clutter.</li>
          <li class="list-item-4">Simplicity is an ongoing process. It&#x27;s not a one-time decision but a continuous effort to refine your products, services, and brand messaging.</li>
          <li class="list-item-5">Simplicity can be a powerful differentiator. In a world of complexity, standing for simplicity can make your brand stand out.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="paragraph-50">By embracing these principles, businesses can harness the power of simplicity to navigate the ever-changing market landscape and achieve sustainable success.</p>
